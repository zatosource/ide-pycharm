# Zato support for IntelliJ products

## Supported products

This plugin requires Python support in your IDE to work properly.
If the Python support is unavailable then the Zato plugin is enabled,
but the synchronisation feature is disabled in this case.

### Versions

Versions **2022.1 and later** are supported by this branch.

### IDEs

Supported are:

- PyCharm Professional
- PyCharm Community
- IntelliJ IDEA Community with the Python plugin installed
- IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate with the Python plugin installed

## Passwords
The passwords of your configured Zato servers are stored in your IDE's [password safe](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/reference-ide-settings-password-safe.html). If you configured the password safe to not store passwords, then you will be prompted for a password the first time a file is uploaded to the configured default Zato server.
